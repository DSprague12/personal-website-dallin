            This week, I felt like the studies went pretty differently. It felt like the verses that stood out to me were the ones that preached of things like hope or 
            perseverance in the face of difficulty. Acts 20:23 really hit me — the idea that Paul knew what was waiting for him in every city and still went anyway is 
            such a powerful message. It’s not that he didn’t know about the suffering ahead; he just trusted that the Lord would protect him and that it would all be 
            worth it. I think that kind of faith is something I want to develop more. It’s easy to trust when things are going well, but real faith is shown when you 
            keep moving forward even when you know trials are coming. That verse helped me realize that the Holy Ghost doesn’t just warn us — He strengthens us, too, 
            and prepares us for what’s ahead.
        </p>

            I also liked how 1 Corinthians 1:5–7 and 1 Thessalonians 5:8 connected everything back to Christ. Those verses made me think more about how every gift, 
            every bit of knowledge, and every strength we have really does come from Him. I like the imagery of putting on “the breastplate of faith and love” and 
            “the helmet of hope.” It reminded me of those “armor of God” lessons from primary, but now it feels a lot more real — like faith, love, and hope aren’t 
            just traits to have, they’re things that protect us spiritually. Going forward, I want to focus more on building those qualities, especially faith and 
            hope. I think if I can hold onto those, I’ll handle challenges with a lot more peace and confidence.

        <h2>November 8th, 2025</h2>
        <p>I will be starting this blog on my personal website for a religion class that I have.</p>
        <p>This week in my class we discussed Acts, chapters one through eighteen. My number one takeaway is how the name of Jesus Christ was used in these chapters.</p>
        <p>Acts 3:6 <i>"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."</i></p>
        <p>
            This is a super common lesson in the scriptures, that in the name of Christ, are all miracles wrought. 
            Peter repeatedly enacts miracles and always does them in the name of Jesus Christ. There is also no overt description of a priesthood blessing, 
            which I find pretty interesting that Peter was able to feel prompted to prompt these miracles to happen. To me that also shows that miracles aren't 
            just limited to holders of the priesthood, and they can occur whenever the Lord sees fit, showing that everyone is equally capable of miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name of Christ is the most powerful thing that Peter the Apostle used in his daily ministry; to do the same things that Jesus himself did. 
            This is something that is demonstrated to us members of the church constantly in the scriptures... that the name of Jesus Christ is the name we 
            take upon ourselves when we are baptized, and is the name that we strive to uphold.
