        <p>
            One scripture I read this week was 1 Timothy 3:15-16, I learned something new as I looked at the King James text and the Joseph Smith 
            Translations. Paul teaches how members of the Church should conduct themselves, and described it as “the church of the living God.” 
            Then the JST adds more to it by emphasizing that the pillar and ground of the church is Jesus Christ. That verse showed me pretty 
            strongly that the church’s purpose is not to alone be the source of truth and authority, but to uphold and direct us to Christ, who 
            is the truth. Seeing these two verses together showed me that the church is built on a living, vital Savior, and that everything it 
            does is designed to point us towards Him.

            As a result of this week’s study, I feel a stronger desire to make Christ the foundation of my discipleship, and not just the 
            products of his Gospel, like the church. It is easy to get caught up in programs, callings, or routines, but these verses reminded 
            me that the Church’s purpose is to help me come to know Jesus Christ personally. I want to be more intentional about seeing every 
            principle and commandment as something that connects me back to the Savior and his Atonement. I’m grateful for how this scripture 
            brought Christ into focus for me this week.

            Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful 
            giver. In my readings this week, I ran across 2 Corinthians 9:7, This verse emphasizes the intention behind our actions God loves 
            a cheerful giver. Your intentions and spirit matter when you give and serve others. I think that's a super important principle 
            shown in this verse. I feel like it also illustrates 
            that it matters more how much effort you put into serving someone, and how much you authentically care and try, rather than the 
            results of what you do. God doesn’t want us to give simply because we feel pressured, obligated, or worried about how others will 
            perceive us. Instead, he wants us to give with willing joy and happiness in serving those around us. And that someone who gives 
            very grudgingly and doesn't really want to serve or sacrifice will mean that in their own mind, the act of giving means less. 
            So that's why we need to be wholeheartedly giving to others and doing our best to serve those that need it.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result of what I learned, I want to be more intentional about how I serve others. I want to focus on not only serving them 
            physically, but also serving them with my love and willingness. I know that cheerful giving can truly change someone's heart for 
            the better, and help them grow more Christlike.

        <h2>November 13th, 2025</h2>

            This week, I felt like the studies went pretty differently. It felt like the verses that stood out to me were the ones that preached of things like hope or 
            perseverance in the face of difficulty. Acts 20:23 really hit me — the idea that Paul knew what was waiting for him in every city and still went anyway is 
            such a powerful message. It’s not that he didn’t know about the suffering ahead; he just trusted that the Lord would protect him and that it would all be 
            worth it. I think that kind of faith is something I want to develop more. It’s easy to trust when things are going well, but real faith is shown when you 
            keep moving forward even when you know trials are coming. That verse helped me realize that the Holy Ghost doesn’t just warn us — He strengthens us, too, 
            and prepares us for what’s ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also liked how 1 Corinthians 1:5–7 and 1 Thessalonians 5:8 connected everything back to Christ. Those verses made me think more about how every gift, 
            every bit of knowledge, and every strength we have really does come from Him. I like the imagery of putting on “the breastplate of faith and love” and 
            “the helmet of hope.” It reminded me of those “armor of God” lessons from primary, but now it feels a lot more real — like faith, love, and hope aren’t 
            just traits to have, they’re things that protect us spiritually. Going forward, I want to focus more on building those qualities, especially faith and 
            hope. I think if I can hold onto those, I’ll handle challenges with a lot more peace and confidence.

        <h2>November 8th, 2025</h2>
        <p>I will be starting this blog on my personal website for a religion class that I have.</p>
        <p>This week in my class we discussed Acts, chapters one through eighteen. My number one takeaway is how the name of Jesus Christ was used in these chapters.</p>
        <p>Acts 3:6 <i>"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."</i></p>
        <p>
            This is a super common lesson in the scriptures, that in the name of Christ, are all miracles wrought. 
            Peter repeatedly enacts miracles and always does them in the name of Jesus Christ. There is also no overt description of a priesthood blessing, 
            which I find pretty interesting that Peter was able to feel prompted to prompt these miracles to happen. To me that also shows that miracles aren't 
            just limited to holders of the priesthood, and they can occur whenever the Lord sees fit, showing that everyone is equally capable of miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name of Christ is the most powerful thing that Peter the Apostle used in his daily ministry; to do the same things that Jesus himself did. 
            This is something that is demonstrated to us members of the church constantly in the scriptures... that the name of Jesus Christ is the name we 
            take upon ourselves when we are baptized, and is the name that we strive to uphold.
