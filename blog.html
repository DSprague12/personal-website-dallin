        <h1>My Blog</h1>
        <h2>November 8th, 2025</h2>
        <p>I will be starting this blog on my personal website for a religion class that I have.</p>
        <p>This week in my class we discussed Acts, chapters one through eighteen. My number one takeaway is how the name of Jesus Christ was used in these chapters.</p>
        <p>Acts 3:6 <i>"Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk."</i></p>
        <p>
            This is a super common lesson in the scriptures, that in the name of Christ, are all miracles wrought. 
            Peter repeatedly enacts miracles and always does them in the name of Jesus Christ. There is also no overt description of a priesthood blessing, 
            which I find pretty interesting that Peter was able to feel prompted to prompt these miracles to happen. To me that also shows that miracles aren't 
            just limited to holders of the priesthood, and they can occur whenever the Lord sees fit, showing that everyone is equally capable of miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name of Christ is the most powerful thing that Peter the Apostle used in his daily ministry; to do the same things that Jesus himself did. 
            This is something that is demonstrated to us members of the church constantly in the scriptures... that the name of Jesus Christ is the name we 
            take upon ourselves when we are baptized, and is the name that we strive to uphold.
